### **Defining Data Science**


#### **Data Science is...**
- Coding, math and statistics in applied setting.
- The analysis of diverse data.
- Inclusive analysis.


#### **Why Choose Data Science?**
- Posesses _rare qualities_.
    - Assigns order, meaning and value to unstructured data.
- Is in _high demand_.
    - Provides insight and competative advantage.

**Primary Skills Required to be a Data Scientist:**

Hacking Skills
- Helps you _gather and prepare data_.
    - Data usually comes from _novel sources_ in _unusual formats_.
    - It requires _creativity_ to get data from these sources into your analysis.
- Coding skills needed...
    - Statistical
        - R & Python
            - Open source, free programing languages.
            - R is specifically for data.
            - Python is general purpose, but well adapted to data.
    - Data base
        - SQL 
            - Structured Querey Language or "sequel".
            - Most common language for working with databases.
    - Command Line Interface
        - Terminal for mac.
        - Bash is the most common language there.
            - Bourne Again Shell.
    - Searching
        - Regex (regular expressions).
        - Not a lot to learn / small field.
        - Super-powered way of searching that makes it possible for you to find data and reformat it in ways that are helpful to your analysis.

Math & Statistics Knowledge
- Probability, algebra, regression, etc.
- Used to determine the appropriate procedures needed.
- Helps to diagnose problems when things don't go as expected.

Substanitive Expertise
- Expertise in the field you are in.
- Need to know about the _goals_ of that field, the _methods_ that are used, and the _constraints_ that people come across. 
- Need to be able to implement results well.

\
**Intersections:**
- Machine Learning (ML)
    - No Domain Expertise
    - "Black box" model
- Traditional Research
    - No Coding / Hacking Skills 
    - Data is typically structured and ready for analysis.
    - Effort is in method / designing of the project and interpretation of data.
- Danger Zone
    - No Math & Statistics
    - Unlikely to happen.
    - Some exceptions include word counts and maps.

\
**Who goes into data science?**
- Coders who can do math, stats and business (most common)
- Statisticians who can code & do business (less common)
- Business people who can code & do numbers (least common)

\
**In summary...**
- Data Science is made up of several fields
- Diverse skills and backgrounds are needed
- Many rolls are involved 

\
**The Data Science Pathway**
1. Planning
    - Define Goals
    - Organize Resources
    - Coordinate People
    - Schedule Project
2. Data Prep.
    - Get Data
    - Clean Data
    - Explore Data
    - Refine Data
3. Modeling
    - Create Model (e.g. regression analysis or neural network)
    - Validate Model (e.g. holdout validation or a small replication)
    - Evaluate Model
    - Refine Model
4. Follow Up
    - Present Model
    - Deploy Model
    - Revisit Model
    - Archive Assets
