**Primary Skills Required to be a Data Scientist:**

Hacking Skills
- Helps you _gather and prepare data_.
    - Data usually comes from _novel sources_ in _unusual formats_.
    - It requires _creativity_ to get data from these sources into your analysis.
- Coding skills needed...
    - Statistical
        - R & Python
            - Open source, free programing languages.
            - R is specifically for data.

    - Effort is in method / designing of the project and interpretation of data.
- Danger Zone
    - No Math & Statistics
    - Unlikely to happen.
    - Some exceptions include word counts and maps.

\
**Who goes into data science?**
- Coders who can do math, stats and business (most common)
- Statisticians who can code & do business (less common)
